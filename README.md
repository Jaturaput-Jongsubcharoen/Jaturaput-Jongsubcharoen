regarding my personal skills in web design, I deeply comprehend the connection between the frontend and backend as a full-stack developer, covering everything from MongoDB to deployment, and using RESTful APIs to read or change data. I know how to use CLI to help create, build, test and maintain Angular application by using terminal commands and react programming using Observables to compose asynchronous by RxJS library. I have trained Oracle Database as a DBA by creating and managing the data orderly. In addition, the attached resume includes more information about my skills and experience. Working as a team, I actively use GitHub to practice working in Agile, Scrum or Kanban methodologies for software development. I am also able to work alongside a cross-functional team of designers, program managers, researchers, legal experts, and more to create new capabilities to enhance upcoming products. Through my academic training and hands-on projects in AI, I fully understand activation within nodes used in training machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network, in order to conduct basic and applied research on relevant open problems in AI by mainly using libraries such as scikit-learn (including OneHotEncoder, Pipeline, and GridSearchCV), imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), NumPy, 
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib, Flask, CSV. Therefore, these experiences give me an understanding of backend processes and have strengthened my ability to work with APIs, manage data flow, and design user-focused interfaces, which are skills directly transferable to frontend development.
